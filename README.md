PROJECT:  Donation tracker    
Duration: 1-2 week

Technologies Used: ejs, JavaScript, node, express, mongo dB
librares used :
 1. bcrypt ( bcrypt allows building a password security platform that can evolve alongside hardware technology to guard against the threats that the future may bring, such as attackers having the computing power to crack passwords twice as fast.)
 2. dotenv
 3. ejs  -- ( EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating) is one of the most popular template engines for JavaScript. As the name suggests, it lets us embed JavaScript code in a template language that is then used to generate HTML )
 4. express
 5. express-flash  -- ( Flash is an extension of connect-flash with the ability to define a flash message and render it without redirecting the request.)
 6. express-session
 7. moment  -- ( MomentJS is a JavaScript library which helps in parsing, validating, manipulating and displaying date/time in JavaScript in a very easy way.)
 8. mongoose
 9  passport js  -- (js. Passport's sole purpose is to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as strategies. Passport does not mount routes or assume any particular database schema, which maximizes flexibility and allows application-level decisions to be made by the developer.)
 
 10. passport-local
